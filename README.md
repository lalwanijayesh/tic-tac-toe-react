# Tic-Tac-Toe in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This is an interactive tic-tac-toe game built in React, following the ['Intro to React'](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial. The follow-along tutorial starts with the basics like implementing props & state in React components, then moves on more complicated things like lifting the state up from child component to parent component, and storing the history of player moves. The code also contains certain enhancements that I made while practicing my React skills.

## Usage

Clone the GitHub repository. In the project directory, run `npm start`. This runs the app in development mode.

Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in the browser.

## Features

* Let the players alternatively take turns to play the game.
* Indicate when a player has won the game.
* Store the game's history as the players make moves.
* Review previous moves and continue game from a particular move.

The code also contains the following improvements, suggested as part of the practice.

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
